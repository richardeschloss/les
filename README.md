# LES - Lightweight Express-ish (Koa) Server -- `les` not more!

(lightweight for real this time...)

STATUS: Initial commit. Not ready for public consumption...

## Installation

npm i -g lesky

(I wanted les, but it was taken. No worries though...the "k" in the name makes it a little more accurate)
